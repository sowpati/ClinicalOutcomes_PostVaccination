# Clinical outcomes of vaccinated individuals hospitalized with the lineage B.1.617.2 (Delta variant) of SARS-CoV-2
Data and code repository for the work on clinical outcomes in breakthrough infections

## How the repository is organized
There are two folders:

- `code` - contains the deidentified data as well as an R script that has all the code to generate the plots, and calculate the stats given in tables of the manuscript
- `plots` - high resolution images used in the article. All of these can be generated using the R script in the `code` folder.

## Contact
For any issues in accessing or running the code, please
- either create a github issue
- or contact Divya Tej Sowpati at tej at ccmb dot res dot in
